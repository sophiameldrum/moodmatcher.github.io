                                    <p>Mood matcher is  a website where users can find a space that will accommodate whatever mood they're in and show them interesting and relaxing content that will be defined by the tone of their mood. The website will have a <a href="https://windsorhealth.co.nz/products/moodrings?variant=29923883057197&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwg8n5BRCdARIsALxKb97XOJkGGj0HsIWd0JFkHxWJK2Z2K6fFk0WLQ_DND22_Ufb0a-ubUWMaAo1oEALw_wcB"> link</a> to order a mood ring from. Once their mood ring arrives they will put it on and it will show them their mood. If users are confident they know what their mood is, the website can also be used without the purchase of a ring. They can then go onto the website and select a link that matches whatever their mood shows, for example green for peaceful, or yellow for nervous and so on. Once they select this link they will be taken to a page that plays a song and shows them art and mixed media that accommodates their mood. There will also be a space where users can leave comments, feedback and questions. They may also share tips that have worked for their mental health. </p>

                                    <p>I have been inspired by my own personal mood rings and how accurate they can be, as they change colour based on the wearer's temperature. I will be recommending  <a href="https://windsorhealth.co.nz/products/moodrings?variant=29923883057197&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwg8n5BRCdARIsALxKb97XOJkGGj0HsIWd0JFkHxWJK2Z2K6fFk0WLQ_DND22_Ufb0a-ubUWMaAo1oEALw_wcB"> Windsor Natural Health Mood Rings</a> for purchase.

                                    I have also been inspired by this <a href="https://www.colourtherapyclinic.com/">Colour Therapy Clinic</a> and their practice.

                                The calming and positive aesthetic was inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harleyandj/">@Harleyandj</a> on Instagram. </p>

                                    <p>The visual direction for mood matcher is to have a professional and clean aesthetic, while also conveying a relaxed and calming tone. It will be approachable, friendly and make the user feel like they are in a safe and positive place. The colour palette will match the colours of the mood ring so that users can visually connect their mood with the colours. Visual aesthetics will be focused on throughout the website with typography not being a key focus. The fonts I will use however are <a href="https://www.dafontfree.io/camaro-sans-serif-font/"> Camaro Sans</a> for headings, and

                                    <a href="https://www.download-free-fonts.com/details/92774/arial-rounded-mt-bold"> Arial Rounded MT Bold</a> </a> for body text. The general aesthetic of the website will be organic and curved.</p>
